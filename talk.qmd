## Who I am

- Software engineer at [Posit](https://posit.co), have been there for just over two years
- Recovering academic

### Detour: Cayce Pollard

- Cayce Pollard is the protagonist of William Gibson's [Pattern Recognition](https://www.powells.com/book/pattern-recognition-9780425198681)
  - (detour: [The Peripheral](https://www.powells.com/book/the-peripheral-9780425276235) is a much better modern Gibson novel, but we're already far afield of this talk now...)
- Pollard has a condition where she's physically allergic to bad logos
- Well, I'm physically allergic to bad software
  - With apologies to [Hedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg): "I used to hate software. I still do, but I used to too."

## What I'm not here for, and what I am

- I'm not here to sell you on Quarto, but I hope you'll like what we're doing with it
- I'm not here to convince you one data science world is better or worse than the other
- I _am_ here to give you perspective on the differences, how they affect organizations, and how we're designing Quarto to help

## The data science worlds (so far)

### The Tidyverse

- RMarkdown (knitr)
- Tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, etc.
- A _Markdown document_ is the "prime" source of truth
  - executed top-to-bottom from the start

### The Jupyter Ecosystem

- (Now, Jupyter means "Julia", "Python", and "R")
- Jupyter Book, MyST Markdown
- Python: Matplotlib, Altair, Pandas
  - And many, many more!
- A _Jupyter notebook_ is the "prime" source of truth
  - naturally stores execution output in a structured format

## Quarto

### Quarto: What

- From [our website](https://quarto.org): An open-source scientific and technical publishing system
- A compatibility layer for the two largest data science ecosystems
- A set of good defaults for a technical website/book
- A way to get an accessible webpage _and_ a publication-ready PDF from the same source
- A (really big) wrapper around Pandoc

### Quarto: Why?

- [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law): "Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure"

## Quarto: Specifics

- Inputs: markdown, Jupyter notebooks
- Outputs:
  - html 
    - single documents: papers, presentations, webpages, emails
    - multiple documents: book chapters, websites
  - pdf (via latex or typst)
  - docx, pptx
  - Confluence, Docusaurus, oh my

## Authoring documents

- RStudio has great support, including a visual editor
- I use VS Code, and it's great too
- Any text editor works

### Collaboration across worlds

- Jupyter and knitr engines can both run on the same project
  - Different book chapters of the same book can use different engines
- Notebook embeds
